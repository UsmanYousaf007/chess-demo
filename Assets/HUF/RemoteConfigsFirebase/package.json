  "description": "Remote Configs module extends AbstractConfigs functionality to update their values from Firebase Remote Configs service. Values aren't updated automatically and you can get them by using Fetch and Apply combination - more information available under documentation.\nThere is cache expiration configurable for this module. By default it is set to 3600 seconds, which means you are able to fetch only 1 time per 3600 seconds. Every fetch during that time will result with fail. It can be changed even to 0 seconds for non block fetching, however there is limit to maximum of 5 fetches per hour. If that limit is exceeded given device will be blocked for 1 hour.",
