  "description": "Remote Configs module extends AbstractConfigs functionality to update their values from Firebase Remote Configs service. Values aren't updated automatically and you can get them by using Fetch and Apply combination - more information available in the documentation.\nCache expiration is configurable for this module. By default it is set to 3600 seconds, which means you are able to fetch only 1 time per 3600 seconds. Every fetch during that time will result in failure. It can be changed even to 0 seconds to stop blocking the fetching, however there is a limit to a maximum of 5 fetches per hour. If that limit is exceeded given device will be blocked for an hour.",
